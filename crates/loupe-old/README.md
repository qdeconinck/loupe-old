ðŸ”Ž `loupe` is a set of tools to analyse and to profile Rust code. For the
moment, it only provides tools about memory usage. It's mostly driven
by [Wasmer]'s needs, but feel free to propose new features!

`loupe` is a French word to express _magnifying glass_, and can be
pronounced exactly like _loop_. The bird above is a _Fauvette Ã 
lunettes_ (_Curruca conspicillata_, Spectacled Warbler).

## Install

The classical `Cargo` step! Add the following line to your
`Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
loupe = "0.1"
```

## Memory Usage

`loupe` provides the `MemoryUsage` trait. It allows to know the size
of a value in bytes, _recursively_. So it traverses most of the types
(some are missing, feel free to contribute!), and its fields or
variants as deep as possible. Hopefully, it tracks already visited
values so that it doesn't enter an infinite ~~_loupe_~~ loop. The
trait looks like this:

```rust
pub trait MemoryUsage {
    fn size_of_val(&self, tracker: &mut dyn MemoryUsageTracker) -> usize;
}
```

`loupe` provides a `size_of_val` function that is a close sibling of
[`std::mem::size_of_val`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.size_of_val.html). It
can be used the same way.

`loupe` exports its best companion: handful procedural macros from the
`loupe-derive` crate, to automatically implement the `MemoryUsage`
trait if possible, on `struct`s and `enum`s.

Thus, one only needs to write:

```rust
use loupe::MemoryUsage;
use std::mem;

#[derive(MemoryUsage)]
struct S {
    x: Vec<i32>,
    y: Vec<i32>,
}

fn main() {
    let s = S {
        x: vec![1, 2, 3],
        y: vec![1, 2, 3],
    };
    
    assert_eq!(48, mem::size_of_val(&s));
    assert_eq!(72, loupe::size_of_val(&s));
}
```

In the example above, we see that each elements of `Vec<i32>` has been
counted in the size of the value `s`. In [Wasmer], it is possible to
get the size of an `Instance`, which traverses `Module`, `Store`,
`Engine`, `Compiler` etc. It's an entire tree of values that is
traversed and the size of each value is summed.

### Opinionated implementations

Even if `MemoryUsage` is already implemented for common types, some
types are missing. We happily welcome more implementations! However,
implementations of `MemoryUsage`:

* must never alter the values,
* must never panic of fail,
* must be deterministic as much as possible (ideally, everytime).

In the same spirit, our implementation of `MemoryUsage` for `*const T`
or `*mut T` (and other pointer types, like `NonNull`, `UnsafeCell`
etc.) just returns the size of the pointer, but it doesn't dereference
the pointer as it's unsafe. It doesn't mean one must not do that: It's
totally possible if it's sure that the pointer can be safely
dereferenced.

Remember that a user can implement `MemoryUsage` by hand; no need to
try to have a default implementation for all the standard types.

Finally, our implementations are certainly not perfect! Feel free to
challenge it and come to discuss!
